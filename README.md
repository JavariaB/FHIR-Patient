"Analysing Distributions of Patients"

The Project is about analyzing distributions of patients with age by looking at the number of patients per their birth dates.This is an interactive web application that allows you to explore the number of patients in various age groups. By visualizing patient data and birth dates, we aim to gain insights into the distribution of patients across different age brackets.

FHIR provides a standardized format for healthcare data exchange, allowing us to efficiently retrieve patient information such as birth dates and demographics from healthcare systems. We'll be leveraging JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to handle and manipulate this data in our app.

To visualize the distribution of patient ages, we integrated D3.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations. With D3.js, we can generate intuitive charts and graphs that help us understand the distribution of patients across different age groups.

To start and run the project please follow following instructions.

Open codespaces via following link       
https://scaling-garbanzo-9r7p7ww549p2774p.github.dev/

Or 

Create a new codespaces on my repo.


Open a terminal and run the following command:       
npm run start

Open another terminal and run the following two commands:

cd fhir_web_app_frontend

serve -s dist



Now run the app and enjoy exploring it.
Thank you.

P.s. For DOMINIK BOHLER ONLY.......  
I am still not sure if you can access my codespaces as a guest. So to be on safe side I sent you invite to be a collaborator. :)
